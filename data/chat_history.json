        "text": "A \"smoke test\" is a common term used in the software development industry to refer to a basic or minimal testing of a system or application to ensure that it is functioning as expected.\n\nIn the context of a script, a smoke test would typically involve running the script and verifying that:\n\n1. The script executes without errors: This can be done by checking for any syntax errors, runtime exceptions, or other issues that might prevent the script from running.\n2. The script produces the expected output: This could include checking the script's output against known results, verifying that the script generates the correct files or data, or ensuring that the script performs the desired actions.\n\nHere are some examples of how a smoke test for a script might be implemented:\n\n* Python script:\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nclass TestScript(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_smoke(self):\n        # Run the script and capture its output\n        output = subprocess.check_output(['script.py'])\n        \n        # Verify that the output is as expected\n        self.assertEqual(output.decode('utf-8'), 'Expected output')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n* Bash script:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Run the script and capture its output\noutput=$(./script.sh)\n\n# Verify that the output is as expected\nif [ \"$output\" != \"Expected output\" ]; then\n  echo \"Script failed smoke test\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n```\nIn both examples, the smoke test involves running the script and verifying that it produces the expected output. This can help ensure that the script is functioning correctly before more comprehensive testing is performed.\n\nReferences:\n\n* \"Smoke Testing: A Guide to Writing Effective Tests\" by Testim.io (https://testim.io/blog/smoke-testing-guide/)\n* \"What is Smoke Testing?\" by Techopedia (https://www.techopedia.com/definition/26634/smoke-testing)"
