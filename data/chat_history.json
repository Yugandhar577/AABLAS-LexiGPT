        "text": "In India, the level of car automation is governed by the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, as amended from time to time. The rules specify the permissible levels of automation for various types of vehicles.\n\nAs per the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, the following levels of automation are permitted:\n\n1. Level 0: No Automation - This level refers to vehicles that do not have any automated features and are solely controlled by human drivers.\n2. Level 1: Driver Assistance Systems (DAS) - This level permits the use of DAS such as anti-lock braking systems (ABS), electronic stability control (ESC), traction control systems (TCS), and lane departure warning systems (LDWS).\n3. Level 2: Partial Automation - This level allows for partial automation, where the vehicle can take control in certain situations, but the driver must remain engaged and ready to take control at all times.\n4. Level 3: Conditional Automation - This level permits conditional automation, where the vehicle can take control in most driving scenarios, but the driver must be prepared to take control if needed.\n5. Level 4: High Automation - This level allows for high levels of automation, where the vehicle can operate independently in most driving scenarios, but may require human intervention in exceptional circumstances.\n6. Level 5: Full Automation - This level permits full automation, where the vehicle can operate independently without human intervention.\n\nThe Indian government has not yet specified a specific level of automation that is permitted for public use. However, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has issued guidelines for the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles in India.\n\nIn 2018, MoRTH issued a notification allowing for the testing of Level 3 and Level 4 autonomous vehicles on Indian roads. The notification specified that such vehicles must be tested in controlled environments and meet certain safety standards before being allowed to operate on public roads.\n\nIn addition, the Indian government has established a framework for the regulation of autonomous vehicles through the \"Guidelines for Testing and Deployment of Autonomous Vehicles\" issued by MoRTH in 2020. The guidelines specify requirements for vehicle design, testing, and deployment, as well as safety standards and liability frameworks.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 (as amended)\n* Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) Notification No. 12/2018-CT dated January 17, 2018\n* MoRTH Guidelines for Testing and Deployment of Autonomous Vehicles, 2020"

I assume you're referring to a method used in software testing to quickly identify whether an application or module is functioning correctly, thereby ensuring it doesn't contain any critical errors or bugs.\n\nA smoke test typically involves running a set of predefined tests to verify the overall functionality of the system or module. This approach helps testers and developers to rapidly identify major issues, thus reducing the time and resources required for more comprehensive testing.\n\n**Legal Implications**\nWhile a smoke test is primarily used in software testing, it may have indirect legal implications in certain situations. For instance:\n\n1. **Contractual Obligations**: In cases where a developer or tester is contracted to deliver a specific product or service, failure to conduct a thorough smoke test might lead to contractual disputes or claims for damages.\n2. **Liability and Risk Assessment**: When a software application or module is released into the market, it may pose risks to users. Conducting a comprehensive smoke test can help minimize these risks and ensure that the application meets legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n**Citations**\n1. \"Smoke Testing\" by Software Testing Help (2022)\nhttps://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/smoke-testing/\n2. \"What is Smoke Testing?\" by Testimonials Inc.

The primary goal of a smoke test is to identify any major issues or bugs that would prevent the system from working correctly.\n\nHere's an example script in Python using the `unittest` module:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nclass SmokeTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_smoke(self):\n        # Test 1: Check if the application starts without errors\n        self.assertTrue(True, \"Application did not start successfully\")\n\n        # Test 2: Verify that a specific feature is working as expected\n        self.assertEqual(2 + 2, 4, \"Math operation failed\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nIn this script:\n\n1. We define a `SmokeTest` class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.\n2. The `test_smoke()` method contains two test cases:\n   - Test 1: Verifies that the application starts without errors.\n   - Test 2: Checks if a specific mathematical operation (2 + 2) returns the expected result.\n\nWhen you run this script, it will execute these tests and report any failures or errors."

The script executes without errors: This can be done by checking for any syntax errors, runtime exceptions, or other issues that might prevent the script from running.\n2. The script produces the expected output: This could include checking the script's output against known results, verifying that the script generates the correct files or data, or ensuring that the script performs the desired actions.\n\nHere are some examples of how a smoke test for a script might be implemented:\n\n* Python script:\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nclass TestScript(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_smoke(self):\n        # Run the script and capture its output\n        output = subprocess.check_output(['script.py'])\n        \n        # Verify that the output is as expected\n        self.assertEqual(output.decode('utf-8'), 'Expected output')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n* Bash script:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Run the script and capture its output\noutput=$(./script.sh)\n\n# Verify that the output is as expected\nif [ \"$output\" != \"Expected output\" ]; then\n  echo \"Script failed smoke test\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n```\nIn both examples, the smoke test involves running the script and verifying that it produces the expected output.
